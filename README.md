## Project Overview

This project tackles a complex multi-tier distribution optimization problem for Amazon's global cargo network. Using linear programming techniques with Python's PuLP library, the solution optimizes transportation costs while maintaining operational constraints across hubs, focus cities, and distribution centers.

**Key Achievement**: Identified 25.4% cost reduction opportunity through Leipzig routing optimization and strategic rate negotiations.

### Problem Scope
- **Geographic Coverage**: Global network spanning USA, Germany, and India
- **Network Scale**: 2 primary hubs, 3 focus cities, 65+ distribution centers
- **Cargo Volume**: 133,747 total tons distributed
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduced from ~$250,000 to $186,435 annually

## Problem Statement

### Business Context
Amazon operates a complex three-tier distribution network:
1. **Primary Hubs**: Large-capacity sorting and distribution facilities
2. **Focus Cities**: Regional distribution points with intermediate capacity
3. **Distribution Centers**: Final delivery points with specific demand requirements

### Optimization Objective
**Minimize total transportation costs** while satisfying:
- Hub capacity constraints
- Focus city capacity limitations
- Flow balance requirements (what comes in must go out)
- Distribution center demand fulfillment
- Network connectivity constraints

### Strategic Considerations
- Leipzig route optimization through negotiated rate reductions
- Capacity utilization efficiency across network tiers
- Direct vs. multi-hop distribution cost-benefit analysis

## Mathematical Formulation

### Decision Variables
- **x_ij**: Flow from hub i to focus city j (tons)
- **y_ik**: Flow from hub i directly to distribution center k (tons)
- **z_jk**: Flow from focus city j to distribution center k (tons)

### Objective Function
```
Minimize: Σ(c_ij * x_ij) + Σ(c_ik * y_ik) + Σ(c_jk * z_jk)
```
Where c represents unit transportation costs per ton.

### Constraints

1. **Hub Capacity Constraints**:
   ```
   Σ(x_ij) + Σ(y_ik) ≤ Hub_Capacity_i  ∀ hubs i
   ```

2. **Focus City Capacity Constraints**:
   ```
   Σ(x_ij) ≤ Focus_Capacity_j  ∀ focus cities j
   ```

3. **Flow Balance at Focus Cities**:
   ```
   Σ(x_ij) = Σ(z_jk)  ∀ focus cities j
   ```

4. **Demand Satisfaction**:
   ```
   Σ(y_ik) + Σ(z_jk) = Demand_k  ∀ distribution centers k
   ```

5. **Non-negativity**:
   ```
   x_ij, y_ik, z_jk ≥ 0
   ```
